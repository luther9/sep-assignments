**Given an unsorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you
  choose between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or
  recursive solution?**

I'd use linear search, because binary search would break on an unsorted array.
I'd use an iterative solution, because recursion would require either an extra
parameter or a helper function.

**Given a sorted collection of a million items, which algorithm would you choose
  between linear search and binary search? Would you use an iterative or
  recursive solution? Explain your reasoning.**

I'd use a binary search, because it's much faster. I'd use an iterative
solution, because recursion would require either extra parameters or a helper
function.
